OWLPY
========================

An open source time series library for Python using Matrix Profile.

## Disclaimer
I started this project because I needed to detect anomalies in [time
series](https://github.com/jbeleno/machine_learning_unicamp/tree/master/exercicio_7_anomalias_em_series_temporais) 
and although Matrix Profile is one of the cutting edge algorithms
for this kind of problems, I realized that this algorithm uses a 
semi-automatic approach to solve my problem. It needs to set explicitly the 
value of M and I needed a complete automatic approach, so I stoped the 
development of this algorithm (STAMP, STOMP, auto-joins, etc.)

Nevertheless, some advances and corrections have been done by 
[Roberto](https://rob-med.github.io/) in his 
[fork](https://github.com/rob-med/owlpy) of my initial GitHub project.
Hence, I consider you should work with his fork.
